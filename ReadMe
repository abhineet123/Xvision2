1) make
2)sudo make install  

If you get any errors like:

make[1]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/local/include/opencv2/core/core.hpp', needed by `XVStereoRectify.o'.  Stop.

Find all the ".depend" files in the sub folders inside "src" (like Consoles, Devices, Tools, etc) and replace all occurences of "/usr/local/include/opencv2" 
with the actual location where "opencv2" include files are present in your system (usually "/usr/include/opencv2")

Note that these ".depend" files are hidden by default so you may need to enable "show hidden files" if using a GUI file browser.
You may need to repeat this for any other include directories whose paths need to be changed.

If you get an error like:

../..//include/XVImageRGB.h:1:1: error: expected unqualified-id before ‘.’ token
 ../src/Images/XVImageRGB.h

This means that the synbolic link files in the "include" folder are being treated as ordinary header files. 
This is usually because the disk where your xvision2 folder resides has a file system (like FAT32 or NTFS) that does not support symbolic links.You can either move it to a linux supported filesystem (like ext3) 
or replace all the .h files in the "include" folder with the actual header files whose location they contain.

  
DO NOT run 'make config'
